## ✅ Requirements Before Pull Request Can Be Merged

> These are enforced by GitHub's branch rules to keep the project clean and consistent:

- ✅ Pull requests must be **reviewed and approved**.
- ✅ If someone comments or requests changes, all **conversations must be resolved**.
- ✅ If new commits are pushed, approvals from reviewers will be **dismissed automatically** until re-approved.
- ❌ Direct commits to the `main` branch are **not allowed**.

## 🧠 Tips

- Keep changes focused. One feature/fix per pull request is best.
- Use clear commit messages (`fix: adjust tab shadow`, `feat: add glass blur effect`, etc.).
- If you're unsure, open an issue first and ask!

Happy customizing ✨
