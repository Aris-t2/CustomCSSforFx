<b>READ THIS BEFORE POSTING A NEW ISSUE REPORT</b>  


1. This is a SUPPORT AREA for features CustomCSSforFx provides.
2. This is not a 'request' area for new stuff or legacy add-on features. Do not open a new issue about something this project does not offer. Instead join the 'General discussions, feedback, questions belong here' thread to ask questions about what is or could be possible with CSS.
3. Read 'how to report issues properly' before posting a new issue.
--> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/issues/4
4. Verify there are no '@namespace' references anywhere in your custom code.
5. Use available support threads:
- GENERAL DISCUSSIONS, FEEDBACK, QUESTIONS --> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/discussions/606
- MULTIROW TABS SUPPORT THREAD --> https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx/discussions/455

<b>IMPORTANT</b>   
By submitting a new issue you confirm having read and understood the above and all 'how to report a new issue' instructions.
