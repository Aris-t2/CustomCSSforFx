# 🌌 AeroGlassyFOX 

> ⚠️ **Please read the [Installation Instructions](#️-how-to-install) carefully to ensure the theme works correctly.**

A personal redesign of Firefox’s UI, inspired by and built upon:

- [Aris-t2’s CustomCSSforFx](https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx)
- [Echelon Firefox Theme](https://github.com/echelon-theme/echelon)

This is a mashup of multiple open-source themes with my own custom tweaks and new styles for a more modern, glassy aesthetic.
